# The Briefcase Kit: Hardware Files



This folder contains files useful for the creation of the hardware for the briefcase kit:



## Hardware Case V1

- nanukCaseV1Panels.ai/dxf : Vector graphics, at scale, of the case's false bottom and upper rim. Suitable for laser cutter or CNC machine. DXF an AI files are the same



## Other Hardware Used:

- M5 Chicago Screws. 6mm and 12mm. I used this set, but ground the 15mm down to 12mm: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B081Q8GKLH



## Assembly Notes

- Most of the work is assembling the false bottom, with the components attached to it, and the wires successfully tucked underneath for the cleanest look. The half-circle holes on the sides of the false bottom are for passing wires from the devices, so they traverse underneath the false bottom. 

- The current assembly process involves a lot of screws on the upper lip piece, I reommend panhead screws for the best look. However, this means if you need to make modifications to the assembly on the false bottom, there are a lot of screws to undo. This will be fixed in V2, but in the meantime, double check your wiring before screwing the upper lip in place.
